Installing Google-Drive-Ocamlfuse

Google Drive Ocamlfuse is available for many different Linux distributions. 
Here’s how to get it working:
Ubuntu

You can install Google Drive Ocamlfuse by adding a PPA. Enter these three 
commands in the terminal to install it.

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:alessandro-strada/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install google-drive-ocamlfuse

Syncing with Google-Drive-Ocamlfuse

To sync with Google, first sign in. Do this by running this command in a 
terminal window:

google-drive-ocamlfuse

Doing this will instantly open a Google Oauth sign in window. Enter the details 
of your Google account to continue.

Then, create the sync folder with:

mkdir -p ~/Google-Drive

With everything set up, syncing can begin. Pull everything down from Google 
Drive with this command:

google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/Google-Drive

Uploading Files

Uploading files to Google Drive with the sync client works the same way as 
downloading. To upload files to a Drive account, simply place any file inside 
the ~/Google-Drive folder, then run the sync command. As Google Drive Ocamlfuse 
starts up, it’ll look over the local sync folder for any changes that might have 
been made and upload those changes. Additionally, deleting a file locally will 
delete it on Drive as well (just run the sync command after deleting something).


Once created go ahead and mount it there by running this command:

google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/googledrive

Pop open Nautilus (or whichever modern file manager you use) and you will see 
your Google Drive mount listed in the sidebar as a device.

When you’re finished editing, adding or copying files you can unmount the fuse 
filesystem with this command:

fusermount -u ~/google-drive
