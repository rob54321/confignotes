# Intstructions on setting up dual boot for linux & windows with uefi boot

Set windows 10 to boot in uefi.
use mbr2gpt in windows to to convert to a gpt partition.
mbr2gpt /? gives help
It may be necessary to delete the linux partitions first.
mbr2gpt /validate will tell if it can be converted.
The bios must be set to boot uefi
run msinfo32 to see status
Windows key + R gives command line

For ubuntu linux
make sure the live cd used to install ubuntu has booted into uefi
in live cd linux as root to check [ -d /sys/firmware/efi ] && "echo Boot in UEFI" || "echo Boot in Legacy"
The directory /sys/firmware/efi must exist in linux if booted in uefi mode.
Install linux and put the boot loader into the boot partition of the system disk /dev/nvme0n1p1
Install in normal way

To fix the boot so grub appears.
In windows open a administrator console


bcdedit /set {bootmgr} path \EFI\ubuntu\grubx64.efi

to go back to windows bootmanager

bcdedit /set \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgr.efi or bootmgfw.efi

bootrec can be used to fix the mbr.
