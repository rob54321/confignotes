HOW TO ACCESS MYDEBIAN FROM A NEW COMPUTER OR NEW DISTRIBUTION

ON THE COMPUTER WHERE THE MYDEBIAN WAS UPDATED

mydebian must be signed again, create the InRelease and Release files
for each distribution that was updated.
if the gpg key exists and the keyFile still exists

then run signmydebian -u | -c | -d | -r
for ubuntu, common, debian or raspbian.


cd /mnt/hdext/mydebian/dists/ubuntu or common or debian etc
gpg --clearsign -o InRelease Release
gpg -abs -o Release.gpg Release

if the key does not exist such as a new install of linux
then a new gpg key will have to be generated for signing
gpg --gen-key

gpg --list-keys to give keyid
gpg --output /mnt/hdext/mydebian/keyFile --armor --export keyid
apt-key add keyFile
then sign as above.

ON THE COMPUTER WHERE MYDEBIAN IS BEING USED
if mydebian was updated and resigned
then on the computer using mydebian
apt-key add /pathto/keyFile
apt-get update
