How to fix the building of makelive.pl post version 23.10

The file /mnt/LINUXLIVE/EFI/BOOT/grubx64.efi has changed and
does not work. When grub boots it simply goes to a text
console.

The file grubx64.efi (size 2.2M) from a previous version
works.

To fix the live system replace grubx64.efi with an older one.

/mnt/ad64/debhome/grubx64.efi -> /mnt/LINUXLIVE/EFI/BOOT

The file file /usr/lib/grub/x86_64-efi/monolithic/grubx64.efi exists on host
it belongs to package grub-efi-amd64-bin

makelive.pl will be modified to copy grubx64.efi from /mnt/ad64
to the live system just after grub has been installed on the live system.
