You can set the hardware clock time standard through the command line. You can check what you have set to use by:
$ timedatectl | grep local
The hardware clock can be queried and set with the timedatectl command. To change the hardware clock time standard to localtime, use:
# timedatectl set-local-rtc 1
If you want to revert to the hardware clock being in UTC, do:
# timedatectl set-local-rtc 0

To set the time zone
timedatectl set-timezone Africa/Johannesburg

dpkg-reconfigure tzdata will change the timezone.
tzselect shows the time zones.
