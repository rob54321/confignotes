How to install samba on the goflex wireless drive.

1. install version 1.3.7 of the firmware by copying the file to
the root directory on the drive and booting. Wait 5 minuts for the software to
install.

2. reset the drive while on. This can be done from the seagate app
or by pushing through the hole in the bottom of the drive.

3. Boot the drive, telnet 172.25.0.1, login with root password goflex.
mkdir /media/sda1/opt, then make link ln -s /media/sda1/opt /opt.
Extra files will now be installed on the drive,
 not in flash ram of which there is very little.

4. cd /etc/opkg , remove all files except arch.conf and opkg.conf.
 Now copy /media/sda1/samba/opkg.conf to /etc/opkg.
This file has  the following 4 lines appended to it:
src cs08q1armel file:///media/sda1/optware

dest root /
lists_dir ext /var/lib/opkg

5. opkg update

6. opkg install samba2

7. copy /media/sda1/samba/smb.conf to /opt/etc/samba

8. copy /media/sda1/samba/S80samba to /opt/etc/init.d/

9. in each of /etc/rc2.d /etc/rc3.d /etc/rc4.d /etc/rc5.d insert a link:
ln -s /opt/etc/init.d/S80samba S98samba ,
Note S98samba is important as this script must run last after boot.
The drive /media/sda1 must already be mounted.

10. S80samba writes a log to /tmp/nmbd.log to check what happend at boot.
