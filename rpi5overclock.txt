When you are readyâ€¦ These are the settings I have used.
this means at 35c the fan will run at 175 until temp drops 5c.
I have played with this a lot over the last few days,
this I found keeps my pi5 around 35c all the time
with very little to no fan noise

# temp is 1000 x celsius
dtparam=fan_temp0=35000
dtparam=fan_temp0_hyst=5000
# speed from 8 to 240
dtparam=fan_temp0_speed=175
