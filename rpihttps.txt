# how to set up https for raspberry pi
# apache2 must be installed
# verify apache2
systemctl status apache2.service

# ip of raspberry pi must be set to static in router.
# set to 192.168.0.100


# check default html page
# browse to http://192.168.0.100/index.html
# where ip is the local ip of raspberry pi

# generate private key and certificate
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.key
  -out certificate.crt

# openssl will ask some questions
# Common name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:192.168.0.100
# this generates 2 files
# files private.key and certificate.crt
# move these files
mv private.key /etc/ssl/private/
mv certificate.crt /etc/ssl/certs/

# edit apache2 configuration 
nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

# edit <VirtualHost *:80> and append this line
# so that all requests to http are redirected to https
<VirtualHost *:80>
        . . .
        Redirect "/" "https://192.168.0.100/"
        . . .

# save file, enable ssl module for apache2 and check config
a2enmod ssl
apache2ctl configtest

# now https://192.168.0.100/index.html 
# will work. Accept risk

# for the router
# a static ip must be set for rpi
# and port forwarding must be done.
# to setup the static ip
# logon to http://192.168.0.1
# add static ip by Connections-Setup -> LAN
# check static IP Addresses known/clients +
# click the + sign.
# add ip address
# make sure it is not int Statistics->DHCP
# apply the settings

# for port forwarding:
Firewall->Virtual Servers
# click the + sign.
# select Template->HTTPS
# fill in 192.168.0.100 into private ip
# also select NAT Loopback -- very important
# for access to port 3306
# select custom, interface all, TCP, NAT Loopback,
#     private IP 192.168.0.100, private port 3306,
#      ADD REMOTE IP PUBLIC port 3306, APPLY
# apply the settings

# NOT necessary to enable DMZ

# to get access to mariadb from the internet
# for eg mysql-workbench
nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
# change line bind-address   =127.0.0.1
# to bind-address   =0.0.0.0
# save file and restart mysql
systemctl restart mariadb

# check with
netstat -ant | grep 3306
# should give
tcp       0      0  0.0.0.0:3306           0.0.0.0*          LISTEN

# grant all rights to robert from any host
grant all on *.* to robert@'%' IDENTIFIED BY coahtr WITH GRANT OPTION;

# to show grants
select User,Host from mysql.user;

# to list all grants
show grants for robert@'%';

# to revoke all grants
revoke all privileges, grant option from robert@'%';

# to delete a user
