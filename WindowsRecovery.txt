Notes on how to make windows recovery for my desktop
and how to include a menu option for grub.

make the install.wim file which is an image of windows C:
	boot windows pe from macrium of windows.iso image
	press shift f10 to open admin console
	run diskpart list vol to see what the driver letters are
	run dism /capture-image /imagefile:D:\backups\install.wim /capturedir:C:\ /name:"MSIRecovery" /compress:maximum /ScratchDir:D:\scratch
		where C: is the windows installation drive, may be different, diskpart will indicate what it is
		where D: is the destination drive, may be different, diskpart will indicate what it is
		dism must be run in a separate windows process to the drive being imaged.

partitions on C: drive
	make a 1GB fat32 partition for booting recovery
	make a sizeof(install.wim) + 3GB ntfs partition for holding sources

	copy all files from windows.iso to fat32 partition except the sources directory.
	this partition must have UUID = 2222-2222
	make a sources directory and put only boot.wim in it.

	copy sources from iso to ntfs partition.
	place the install.wim file in sources dir on ntfs partition.
	maybe rename install.esd to install.esd.bak in sources.
	install.esd is default image.

Grub
	edit /boot/grub/custom.grub to include a menu item 
	for booting recovery. It only boots in UEFI mode.

/boot/grub/custom.cfg
	set menu_color_normal=white/blue
	set menu_color_highlight=red/light-gray
	set color_normal=yellow/blue
	set color_hightlight=red/black

	menuentry 'Windows MSI Recovery (on /dev/nvme1n1p4)' --class windows --class os $menuentry_id_option 'osprober-efi-2222-2222' {
		savedefault
		insmod part_gpt
		insmod fat
		search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set=root 2222-2222
		chainloader /bootmgfw.efi
	}
