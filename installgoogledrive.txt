How to use Google Drive Ocamlfuse

With the install complete you can go ahead and set up the app to work with your 
Google Drive account. While there isn’t a fancy-pants GUI front-end for setting 
things up don’t feel put. GDO is super simple to use via the CLI.

To get started run the app from the command line using this command:

google-drive-ocamlfuse

The first time you do this the utility will create all the relevant config files 
and folders it needs to mount your Google Drive account. It will also launch 
your default web browser so that you sign in and authorize access to your Google 
Drive files.

Sign in with your Google username and password and, when the screen above 
appears, grant the utility permission to access your files and folders.

That’s it; you’re pretty much good to go!

All that’s left is to create an empty folder in which to mount Google Drive on 
your system.

mkdir ~/googledrive

Once created go ahead and mount it there by running this command:

google-drive-ocamlfuse ~/googledrive

Pop open Nautilus (or whichever modern file manager you use) and you will see 
your Google Drive mount listed in the sidebar as a device.

When you’re finished editing, adding or copying files you can unmount the fuse 
filesystem with this command:

fusermount -u ~/google-drive

You can try to unmount it using the eject button you’ll see in Nautilus, Nemo, 
etc but this won’t work; you’ll get a permissions error.
